#### Digital Clock HTML, CSS, JavaScript

> Basic Digital Clock and Countdown Timer

> First created after watching a youtube tutorial and wanting to try creating one by myself. Created in the very early stages of my programming journey.

#### Future Considerations | Additions


> Uses arrow functions which is not compatible with all browsers: Use babel to compile down to es6 or replace all arrow functions

```bash
    addEventListener("click", () => {})

    replace

    addEventListener("click", function() {})
```

> Add CSS Transitions and styling changes

> Refactor JavaScript to make it more cleaner and maintainable
